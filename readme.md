# Research_Project

In the Research Work Algorithm's used were :-
1. SVM
2. Random Forest
3. ANN
Where ANN outscored the other alorithms.
1. Accuracy => 98.62%
2. Accuracy of SVM => 97.79%
3. Accuracy of Random Forest => 98.16%


/*Rest other algorithms are just incorporated on the dataset for exploration purpose.*/
