# Research_Project

In the Research Work Algorithm's used were :-

Toal 3 algorithms were used : 2 of Machine Learning's and 1 is Neural Networks[ANN]
1. SVM

2. Random Forest

3. ANN

Where ANN outscored the other alorithms.

1. Accuracy => 98.62%

2. Accuracy of SVM => 97.79%

3. Accuracy of Random Forest => 98.16%



*Rest other algorithms are just incorporated on the dataset for exploration purpose.*
