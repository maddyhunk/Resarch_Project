# Research_Project

In the Research Work Algorithm's used were :-
1. SVM
2. Random Forest
3. ANN
Where ANN outscored the other alorithms by achieving accuracy => 98.62%. \n
Accuracy of SVM => 97.79%
Accuracy of Random Forest => 98.16%


/*Rest other algorithms are just incorporated on the dataset for exploration purpose.*/
